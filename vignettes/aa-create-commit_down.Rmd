# Read list of commits

## Reproducible example

Create a versioned directory with some commits and a NEWS.md

- Some commits mention an issue with `#`
- Some commits mention a ticket with `ticket`
- A commit is associated with a tag

```{r}
repo <- fake_repo()
```

# Get commits and find pattern

- Find all commits of a branch and associate with tags recursively

```{r}
get_commits_tags(repo, ref = "master")
```

- Find all commits of a branch and detect a specific pattern
    + Here we find commits mentionning an issue with `#123`
```{r}
get_commits_pattern(repo, pattern = "#[[:digit:]]+", ref = "master")
```
