The goal of {gitdown} is to build a bookdown report of commit messages arranged according to a pattern. Book can be organised according to git tags, issues mentionned (*e.g.* `#123`) or any custom character chain included in your git commit messages (*e.g.* `category_` for use like `category_ui`, `category_doc`, ...).

## Installation

You can install the last version of {gitdown} from Github:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/gitdown")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(gitdown)
## Create fake repository for the example
repo <- fake_repo()
```

Get commits with issues mentionned. The searched pattern is a `#` followed by at least one number: `pattern = "#[[:digit:]]+"`.

```{r}
get_commits_pattern(repo, pattern = "#[[:digit:]]+", ref = "master") %>% 
  select(pattern, everything())
```

## Create a gitbook of commits sorted by a pattern

```{r, eval=FALSE}
git_down(repo, pattern = c("ticket[[:digit:]]+","#[[:digit:]]+"), 
         names_section = c("Ticket", "Issues"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("reference/figures/gitdown_screenshot.png")
```
